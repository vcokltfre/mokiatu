SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a [cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a [message digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_digest) â€“ typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long. It was designed by the United States [National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency), and is a U.S. [Federal Information Processing Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard).

Since 2005, SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents; as of 2010 many organizations have recommended its replacement. NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011 and disallowed its use for digital signatures in 2013. As of 2020, [chosen-prefix attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-prefix_attack) against SHA-1 are practical. As such, it is recommended to remove SHA-1 from products as soon as possible and instead use SHA-2 or SHA-3. Replacing SHA-1 is urgent where it is used for [digital signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures).

All major web browser vendors ceased acceptance of SHA-1 [SSL certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL_certificate) in 2017. In February 2017, CWI Amsterdam and Google announced they had performed a [collision attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack) against SHA-1, publishing two dissimilar PDF files which produced the same SHA-1 hash. But SHA-1 is still secure for HMAC.
