SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of [cryptographic hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001. They are built using the Merkle–Damgård construction, from a [one-way compression function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_compression_function) itself built using the Davies–Meyer structure from a specialized [block cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher).

SHA-2 includes significant changes from its predecessor, [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1). The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with [digests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#message_digest) (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256. SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384 are truncated versions of SHA-256 and SHA-512 respectively, computed with different initial values. SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are also truncated versions of SHA-512, but the initial values are generated using the method described in [Federal Information Processing Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards) (FIPS) PUB 180-4.

Currently, the best public attacks break [preimage resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack) for 52 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256 or 57 out of 80 rounds of SHA-512, and [collision resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack) for 46 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256.
